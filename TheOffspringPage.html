  <h1>The Offspring</h1>
  <br/>
  <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Though I've been listening to them for a long time now, I never actually got
  around to listening to almost only Offspring for an extended period of time. Furthermore,
  I only really focused on the two or three albums I knew for the longest time (being <i>
  Ixnay on the Hombre</i> and <i>Smash</i>). After I branched out into <i>Americana</i> and eventually
  <i>Ignition</i>, I found myself liking them more than I ever had. Some titles, as with Green Day,
  did eventually span more into "emo" music as a genre and strayed from the original sound of early
  Offspring, and I definitely disliked those songs and albums more. However, all in all they've
  been one of my favorite bands that I was actually lucky enough to see live a few years ago.</p>
