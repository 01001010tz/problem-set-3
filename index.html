    <title>My Music Taste I Guess</title>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> I've always personally listened to older music in that my favorite bands,
      songs, and albums tend to predate around 2000. My taste comes from what my parents
      listen to, but I get a lot more of my specific tastes from my dad, who would almost exclusively
      play his music on car rides or in the background of everyday tasks. In terms of genre, most of it
      falls within the bounds of (punk) rock, grunge, classic rock, and ska (in descending order) Music has
      always been a big part of my life, as I find I'm always listening to something even as I do things
      in my day-to-day life, and I have also pursued music education partly because of what I listen to.</p>
